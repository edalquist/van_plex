This is for a new script
My goal is to rsync a folder of media files to a rasperry pi every time it comes online on the network.
The script doing the rsync is running on a local server, it will connect to the rasperry pi via SSH key
The local server will need to detect when the rapsberry pi joins the local network
The raspberry pi has a hostname of van-media.home.dalquist.org
The script should take a list of source > dest directory path pairs and rsync each pair
Files that do not exist in the source should be removed from the dest
This script should check for the presence of the pi fairly often, every few minutes ideally
The script should be careful to not end up trying to run multiple times concurrently
